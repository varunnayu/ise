<section id="about">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Information Technology builds tools to manipulate, organize, transmit, and store 
Information in Digital form. It amplifies Brainpower in a way analogous to that in 
which the Nineteenth Century Industrial Revolution”s Technology of Steam Engines, 
Metallurgy and Giant Power Tools multiplied muscle power. Information Technology builds 
the most all-purpose tools ever, Tools for thought. The future belongs to knowledge
based Industries. Strength of a 
Country depends upon the best use of Information Technology in all walks of life.</p>
